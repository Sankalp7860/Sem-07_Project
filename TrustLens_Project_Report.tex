\section{Introduction}

\begin{primarybox}[Overview]
\textbf{TrustLens} is an innovative mobile application designed to combat the growing threats of deepfake media and fraudulent job postings in the digital age. Leveraging cutting-edge artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, TrustLens provides users with powerful tools to verify the authenticity of digital content before interaction, helping protect individuals from sophisticated fraud schemes and manipulated media.

In an era where deepfake technology has become increasingly accessible and job scams proliferate on online platforms, the need for robust verification tools has never been more critical. TrustLens addresses this challenge by integrating state-of-the-art machine learning models capable of detecting synthetic media manipulation and identifying fraudulent employment opportunities with high accuracy.

The application serves as a comprehensive fraud detection platform, combining deepfake detection capabilities with intelligent job posting analysis. By providing real-time threat assessment with detailed confidence scores and explanatory reports, TrustLens empowers users to make informed decisions about the content they encounter online, protecting their personal information and financial security.

Built with modern cross-platform technologies including React Native for mobile development, Python Flask for ML model serving, and Google Gemini AI for intelligent assistance, TrustLens represents a holistic approach to digital fraud prevention that prioritizes both security effectiveness and user experience. The application's community platform further enhances protection by enabling users to share experiences and learn from collective security intelligence.
\end{primarybox}

\section{Problem Statement}

The digital landscape faces two critical and escalating threats:

\subsection{Deepfake Media Proliferation}

Deepfake technology has evolved from a technical curiosity to a significant threat to digital trust and personal security. Synthetic media generation tools are now accessible to non-experts, enabling the creation of convincing fake videos, images, and audio recordings. These manipulated media assets are weaponized for:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Identity theft and impersonation:} Fraudsters create fake videos of public figures or individuals for scams
    \item \textbf{Misinformation campaigns:} Fabricated content spreads false narratives and damages reputations
    \item \textbf{Financial fraud:} Deepfake videos used in business email compromise and CEO fraud
    \item \textbf{Social manipulation:} Fake content influences public opinion and political discourse
\end{itemize}

Traditional detection methods struggle to keep pace with advancing generation techniques, creating an urgent need for accessible, AI-powered verification tools.

\subsection{Job Posting Fraud Epidemic}

Online job platforms have become breeding grounds for sophisticated employment scams that target job seekers:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Financial exploitation:} Fraudulent postings demand upfront fees for training, equipment, or background checks
    \item \textbf{Identity theft:} Fake employers collect personal information including SSNs and financial details
    \item \textbf{Work-from-home scams:} Unrealistic salary promises and vague job descriptions lure desperate job seekers
    \item \textbf{Pyramid schemes disguised as jobs:} Multi-level marketing schemes presented as legitimate employment
\end{itemize}

These scams cause significant financial and emotional harm to vulnerable populations, with losses often exceeding thousands of dollars per victim. Manual verification of job postings is time-consuming and requires expertise that most job seekers lack.

\textbf{TrustLens bridges these critical gaps by providing instant, AI-powered analysis of both media authenticity and job posting legitimacy, democratizing access to advanced fraud detection capabilities.}

\section{App Purpose and Objectives}

TrustLens is designed to serve as a comprehensive fraud prevention ecosystem with the following core objectives:
